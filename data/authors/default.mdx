ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Daniel, born in Germany just before 1990, currently working as Senior Solution Architect at [Heidelberg Materials](https://heidelbergmaterials.com).

During the day, I'm mainly focussed on infrastructure topics. Originally I started as network engineer, obtained various certifications over the years (currently holding two active CCIE certifications, #55056). Over time,
my focus expanded towards network security. Nowadays, I'm mainly working on cloud migration strategies, cloud infrastructure in general and automation topics, both for more traditional infrastructre as well as cloud-native applications including GitOps and Kubernetes.

In my free time, I started to get into the world of Making, ultimately ending up as chairman of the management board of [Makerspace Darmstadt e.V.](https://makerspace-darmstadt.de) for more than 4 years.
My time there was essentially split between working on my own projects (mainly woodworking, CNC milling, lasercutting and electronics) and developing the IT infrastructure of the Makerspace.

While the Makerspace is mainly intended for physical work, the IT infrastructure is quite massive today, including a Kubernetes cluster, various public services, a NextJS based frontend and Python / FastAPI based backend, an MQTT cluster, a custom locking system for unattended member access, and much more.
Those topics for sure will be covered in some blog posts as well!

I'm always happy to help out with any questions you might have, so feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
